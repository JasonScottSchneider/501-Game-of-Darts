# 501-Game-of-Darts
This is a darts game called 501 that can be played in the terminal with the Swift programming language. (Note: The folder included is a playground for XCode, separate from the 501.swift file. I uploaded both to give the choice between using a playground in XCode or just straight in the terminal.)
Here is an example below:
<br>
<br>
\$ swift 501.swift
